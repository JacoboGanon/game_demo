# Game Demo
This game is a very basic example of the game mechanics of the game.

There are little drops dropping like rain with math equations, users input the answer to the math equations and they get it right (currently there is just a counter but eventually they will move into a jar and questions they get wrong will be put in as contamination).

Currently it is a bit hard to finish the game, you need 25 correct answers with less than 3 wrong, I might change the cap speed depending on how I see people do with this game but I like it being hard because it forces you to stop thinking and start going a bit off instinct.

There are audio cues for getting a question right or wrong. I added a cooldown between getting questions wrong because sometimes users will try and answer something quickly after getting one wrong and get another one wrong. If a rain drop falls to the bottom of the screen it will also count as it being wrong.
